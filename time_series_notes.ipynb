    "    * adjust frequency - aggregate the data of 30 days for a monthly frequency\n",
    "    * increase frequency - approximate the data point in between the data points\n",
    "3. We can't run some ML models on the time series data: Due to the dependencies between consecutive periods in a time series data, we cannot shuffle the data\n",
    "4. Quantile-Quantile Plot (QQ plot): Used to determine whether a dataset distributed a certain way, usually showcase if it's a normal distribution> x-axis means if you follow that distribution, you should get the expected value, then you go on and check the actual sample values and order them, as the y-axia to plot it. y=x is the optimal line that your model does follow that distribution"
