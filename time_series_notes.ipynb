    "    * adjust frequency - aggregate the data of 30 days for a monthly frequency\n",
    "    * increase frequency - approximate the data point in between the data points\n",
    "3. We can't run some ML models on the time series data: Due to the dependencies between consecutive periods in a time series data, we cannot shuffle the data\n",
    "4. Quantile-Quantile Plot (QQ plot): Used to determine whether a dataset distributed a certain way, usually showcase if it's a normal distribution> x-axis means if you follow that distribution, you should get the expected value, then you go on and check the actual sample values and order them, as the y-axia to plot it. y=x is the optimal line that your model does follow that distribution"

    "1. White Noise: a special type of time-series, where the data doesn't follow a pattern. It has to follow constant mean at 0, constant variance, and no autocorrelation in the period(no clear correlation between past and current time series value)\n",
    "2. Random Walk: a special type of time-series, where values tend to persist over time and the differences between series are simply white noises. Pt = Pt-1 + eposlin, where eposlin is a white noise distribution. It's more similar to a normal pice data, with smaller variation between consecutive time period, and it has cyclical increases and decreases in short period of times. if a stock market is a random walk, then the price cannot be predicted.\n",
    "3. Stationarity: taking a same time period, the time series data will have the same covariance, constant mean, constant variance, no matter what the starting point is.  \n",
    "    * It is called Covariance Stationarity (Weak Stationarity), and white noise satisfy this property.\n",
    "    * Strict Stationarity need the same time period of data having the SAME distribution, but it is seldom observed in real world\n",
    "4. Seasonality: the trends will appear on a cyclical basis. How to identify?\n",
    "    * Decomposition: Trend (express the pattern), Seasonal (express Cyclical effects), and residual (error of prediction)\n",
    "    * Naive decomposition: split into these three parts. Additive: the observed = trend + seasonal + residual; Multiproductive: observed = trend * seasonal * residual\n",
    "5. Correlation lo(x, y) = measures the similarity in the change of values of two time series\n",
    "6. Autocorrelation: the correlation between a sequence and itself. It measures the resemblance of the actual series data to a lagged version of itself. Which for example, means that to find the similarity of previous day(year) to this day(year)."
